# Machine-Learning-Courses-And-Projects

A comprehensive, chronological portfolio documenting my progression from Python fundamentals to classical machine learning, applied computer vision, and modern deep learning frameworks.
This repository reflects a deliberate engineering mindset: master fundamentals → build real projects → evaluate tools critically → migrate to modern frameworks → tackle domain‑specific deep learning problems.

# Learning Journey & Project Timeline
## 1. Python Programming Intro (Entry + Associate Levels)
This section contains a full foundational Python curriculum, including:

### Entry Level Modules
Basic syntax, variables, operators
Input/output
Control flow (if/else, loops)
Data types and type casting
Functions, recursion, generators
Exceptions and error handling
Data collections (lists, tuples, dicts, strings)

### Associate Level Modules
Modules and packages
Strings and text processing
Object‑oriented programming (inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, introspection)
Exceptions (hierarchy, propagation, custom exceptions)
File I/O, lambdas, comprehensions, closures
Small projects (password generator, rock‑paper‑scissors, todo list)

### Skills demonstrated:  
Clean coding habits, modular design, debugging, OOP fundamentals, and strong Python fluency — all foundational for ML and deep learning.

## 2. Traditional Machine Learning Course
A full end‑to‑end ML curriculum covering:

### Core Data Skills
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Data analysis capstone project

### Supervised Learning
Linear regression
Logistic regression
K‑Nearest Neighbors
Support Vector Machines
Decision trees
Random forests
Boosted trees (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting)

### Unsupervised Learning
K‑Means
Hierarchical clustering
DBSCAN
PCA (manual + scikit‑learn)

### Model Deployment
Model persistence
Serving models via API

### Skills demonstrated:  
Feature engineering, preprocessing, model evaluation, visualization, and reproducible ML workflows.

## 3. Water Level Identification Project (Pre‑Deep Learning)
A real‑world applied ML/CV project completed before learning TensorFlow or PyTorch.

### Project Highlights
Built a dataset of water‑level images
Performed classical ML modeling and regression
