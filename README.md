# Machine-Learning-Courses-And-Projects

A comprehensive, chronological portfolio documenting my progression from Python fundamentals to classical machine learning, applied computer vision, and modern deep learning frameworks.
This repository reflects a deliberate engineering mindset: master fundamentals → build real projects → evaluate tools critically → migrate to modern frameworks → tackle domain‑specific deep learning problems.

# Learning Journey & Project Timeline
## 1. Python Programming Intro (Entry + Associate Levels)
This section contains a full foundational Python curriculum, including:

### Entry Level Modules
Basic syntax, variables, operators

Input/output

Control flow (if/else, loops)

Data types and type casting

Functions, recursion, generators

Exceptions and error handling

Data collections (lists, tuples, dicts, strings)

### Associate Level Modules
Modules and packages

Strings and text processing

Object‑oriented programming (inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, introspection)

Exceptions (hierarchy, propagation, custom exceptions)

File I/O, lambdas, comprehensions, closures

Small projects (password generator, rock‑paper‑scissors, todo list)

### Skills demonstrated:  
Clean coding habits, modular design, debugging, OOP fundamentals, and strong Python fluency — all foundational for ML and deep learning.

## 2. Traditional Machine Learning Course

Serving models via API

### Skills demonstrated:  
Feature engineering, preprocessing, model evaluation, visualization, and reproducible ML workflows.

## 3. Water Level Identification Project (Pre‑Deep Learning)
A real‑world applied ML/CV project completed before learning TensorFlow or PyTorch.

### Project Highlights
Built a dataset of water‑level images

Performed classical ML modeling and regression

Convolutional neural networks

Transfer learning (feature extraction + fine‑tuning)

NLP with TensorFlow

TensorFlow Hub

GPU‑accelerated training

Callbacks, checkpoints, and regularization

### Major Projects
Food Vision Big (Milestone Project 1)

SkimLit (Milestone Project 2)

Custom image augmentation and model experimentation

### Skills demonstrated:  
Deep learning fundamentals, CNNs, transfer learning, experiment tracking, and scalable training workflows.

## 5. TensorFlow Projects
This folder contains polished, submission‑ready versions of:

## 7. In‑Progress: NFL Play Type Prediction (TensorFlow → PyTorch)
### Phase 1 — TensorFlow Baseline (Completed)
Built a working deep learning model to classify NFL play types using:

Situational features

Categorical encodings

Dense neural networks

Slice‑based error analysis

This validated the modeling approach and dataset structure.

### Phase 2 — Migration to PyTorch (In Progress)
After evaluating long‑term maintainability and industry trends, I migrated the project to PyTorch.

### Why PyTorch?
More Pythonic and flexible

Cleaner debugging and control

Stronger ecosystem momentum

Better long‑term maintainability

Native GPU acceleration on my hardware

Ideal for future sequence models (LSTM, GRU, Transformer)

### Final Project Goals
TensorFlow baseline (to be uploaded)

PyTorch migration (in progress)

Modular training loops

Custom metrics and losses

Situational feature engineering

Slice‑based error analysis

Sequence models for temporal prediction

Deployment‑ready demo (Hugging Face Spaces or Streamlit)

This will become the flagship project of the repository.
